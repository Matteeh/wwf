# Chomie

The main objective of this project was to create an application that would solve the displeasure of watching YouTube videos simultaneously together with a group of people over the internet. The annoyance lies in the lack of a feature that would allow you to start, pause and jump to specific timelines of a said video with a group of people. This application solves this by creating an environment where you have access to all these features while still being able to watch the same video that one could watch on YouTube.
